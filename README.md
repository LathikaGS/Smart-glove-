# Smart Glove â€“ Sign Language to Speech & Text Translator

A wearable assistive device that helps bridge communication gaps for the hearing and speech impaired by translating hand gestures (sign language) into text and speech using sensors and machine learning.

## Features

- Real-time sign language recognition
- Displays corresponding text on a screen (PC/mobile)
- Converts recognized gestures to speech using text-to-speech
- Lightweight and user-friendly glove design
- Wired connection (USB) for data transmission

## Technologies Used

| Hardware              | Software / Tools             |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| MPU6050 (IMU Sensor) | Python / Arduino / C++       |
| Flex Sensors         | Scikit-learn / Pandas        |
| Arduino Nano or UNO  | Serial Communication (PySerial) |
| Speaker or Buzzer    | pyttsx3 (Python TTS library) |

## How It Works

1. **Gesture Input**: User performs a hand gesture representing a sign.
2. **Sensor Data Collection**: MPU6050 and flex sensors measure hand orientation and finger bend angles.
3. **Data Transmission**: Arduino reads sensor values and sends them over USB.
4. **Recognition**: A machine learning model running on a PC classifies the gesture.
5. **Output**: The corresponding word or character is:
   - Displayed on the screen
   - Spoken aloud using a TTS engine

## Machine Learning Model

- **Input**: Sensor values from MPU6050 and flex sensors
- **Model**: Trained using Scikit-learn (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)
- **Training**: Custom dataset collected from multiple samples per gesture
- **Accuracy**: Dependent on dataset quality and number of gestures
